	<h5>How to play...</h5>
	<p>You will be provided with a word of seven letters or more which we'll call the "sourceword". You are then to think up seven three-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the sourceword, ensuring that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.</li>
		<li>Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a “real” word).</li>
		<li>The words all have three letters or more.</li>
		<li>There are no duplicate words.</li>
		<li>None of the seven words is the source word.</li>
		<li>And don't forget: case is NOT significiant (Pet, PET, and pet are the *same* word).</li>
	</ul>
